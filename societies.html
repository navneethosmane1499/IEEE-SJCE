                                    IEEE-SJCE Student Branch which started as an elite group 29 years ago, today has sprawled throughout the campus of SJCE, making the students technically more competitive, more professional and enhancing their abilities as an engineer. Since then IEEE-SJCE STUDENT BRANCH, a division under region 10 of IEEE has been known for the immensity with which its members were bestowed. The very success story of it students as professionals into their respective fields after graduations speaketh of its standards.<br>
            
                                    IEEE-SJCE now has about 330+ members from six fields of engineering: Biotechnology, Computer Science, Electronics & Communication, Electrical & Electronics, Information Science and instrumentation technology. Apart from these many students from various post graduation departments have also subscribed to be the members.<br>
                                    
                                    IEEE-SJCE conducts two annual technical fests - TUXEDO, a linux fest during the odd semesters and CYBERIA, the annual technical fest conducted during the even semesters. CYBERIA was instigated 19 years ago and till now it has been organized for 18 years. The events in the fest are so organized as to give students from all branches of engineering, irrespective of them being members or not and irrespective of their branches to show case their talents and abilities.<br>
                                    
                                    In order to make students technically competitive technical tests on C programming microprocessors etc are conducted. Various workshops and crash courses are also organized. An annual leadership workshop adores the calendar of events every year, which helps the students to improve as leaders and inculcates in them, the spirits of true leaders. Apart from this, lots of talks are organized from people representing industry, academia and research as well.<br>
                                    
                                    The standards of IEEE-SJCE were proven the best when it was awarded the <b>Best student Branch</b> for the year 2003-2004. Among the competitors for this tag were the top colleges of VTU, Manipal institute of technology and NITK, Suratkal as well.<br>
                                    
                                    IEEE-SJCE is also proud of nurturing <b>IEEE-EDS STUDENT CHAPTER</b>. IEEE-SJCE is the only student branch to have gained permission to start this chapter throughout India. IEEE-SJCE also has a Women in Engineering Student Chapter.<br><br>

                                    IEEE SJCE EDS has been providing students with the basic electronics knowledge since its inception. It has helped students get more familiarized with electronic components, the various techniques of circuit making and the basics of robot building.<br><br>
            
                                    <text style="color: #384158;font-weight: 600;">SNAP CIRCUITS</text><br>
                                    Snap circuit product is a tool for entering the exciting world of electronics. Electronics plays an important and increasing role in everyday lives, and so it is important to have some basic knowledge of it.<br>
            
                                    In this workshop the students have hands-on session of basic electrical and electronics circuits. The workshop is conducted for first and second year students exclusively. The students are allowed to explore different circuits with the help of the manuals which come along with the kits under the supervision of volunteers.<br><br>
            
                                    <text style="color: #384158;font-weight: 600;">SOLDERING AND ETCHING WORKSHOP</text><br>
                                    Soldering is a concept used in each and every electronic appliance. It is necessary to know the proper soldering techniques. Keeping this in mind, IEEE SJCE EDS conducts Soldering and Etching workshop in odd semesters, where senior IEEE EDS members teach the 2nd years and 1st years. They make participants etch a simple circuit and solder it.<br><br>
            
                                    <text style="color: #384158;font-weight: 600;">ROBOTICS WORKSHOP</text><br>
                                    As they say our knowledge is volatile in nature until we apply the concept of our knowledge in real time situation. Hence Robotics 8.X, one of the biggest events was conducted by the IEEE-SJCE EDS Chapter.<br>
            
                                    The main highlights of the workshop was that the participants got to learn robotics from scratch and then move on to more advanced topics like Bluetooth controlled robots, voice controlled robots, DTMF controlled robots and even Android app controlled robots.<br><br>
            
                                    <text style="color: #384158;font-weight: 600;">VACATION PROJECT MANIA</text><br>
                                    "Whatever we possess becomes of double value when we have the opportunity of sharing it with others" this famous adage of Jean Nicolas embodies the idea of conducting VPM.<br>
            
                                    Vacation Project Mania, an initiative of IEEE SJCE EDS is conducted during the vacations. VPM is basically an interactive session in which the seniors and juniors mingle together to share their knowledge, ideas and most important of all, an experience, but the torch bearers of this successful mania are the seniors without a doubt.<br>
            
                                    VPM gets huge response from all circuit branches, around 120 students attend the project sessions every day for 4 hours VPM played prominent role in generating practical impulse in minds of young budding engineers.<br><br>

                                           <b> IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE)</b> is a global network of IEEE members and volunteers dedicated to promoting women engineers and scientists, and inspiring girls around the world to follow their academic interests in a career in engineering and science. It is the world’s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. Its goal is to facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally. IEEE WIE envisions a vibrant community of IEEE women and men collectively using their diverse talents to innovate for the benefit of humanity.<br><br>

                                            The idea of WIE chapter in IEEE SJCE student branch was conceived and implemented only a couple of years ago. Since its inception, the chapter has been responsible for several activities and initiatives. WIE team have made frequent visits to several organizations <b> to reach out to underprivileged children and educate them about their chances in engineering.</b><br><br>
                                            IEEE-SJCE WIE also organises distinguished lectures by women professionals who help in encouraging young girls to strive hard and motivate in achieving excellence in academics and profession. Apart from this, the WIE chapter of the student branch is also involved in organising technical competition and workshops. The team intenda to continue these activities along with implementation of newer ideas. <br><br>
